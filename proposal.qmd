description: "For starters, my goal to create an interactive dashboard is due to the utiliy I see in creating such a dashboard in my current career. 
                Creating an interactive dashboard is something I have never pushed myself to do, and so, while I may regret the extra work, I find
                it'll be a task with high future reward. I also think that an interactive dashboard is a favorable way to get the viewers interested 
                in the data. /n
              Secondly, the reason i'd like to study crime in Mexico has to do with my background. I grew up spending all of my summers in Mexcio, I
                even attended kindergarten there. I expereince different worlds in Mexico, as I would stay a small town in the mountains and at time
                on the Pacific Coast at a large turism City
               "
